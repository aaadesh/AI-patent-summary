# AI-patent-summary

This tool provides a well-written summary for patent using AI. To write the summary we take patent number as input and extract the title, claim and full text from Google Patents. 

Then we pass on the patent details with specialized prompts to OpenAI using their API.

The results are presented on a clean UI made using Gradio.
